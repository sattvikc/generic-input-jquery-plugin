Generic Input Jquery Plugin
---------------------------

An easy to use plugin to take in generic input data for python backend. 
Currently the plugin supports String, Numbers, Tuples, Arrays and Dictionaries.
This is useful where a generic input is needed for configuring python file based
settings on the backend.

TODO
----
* Retain data when changing data types.
* Ability to feed in pre-defined structure.
* More UI flexibility.
